    <h2>This is the recipe for this amazing pizza!</h2>
    <p>Homemade pizza is a classic, customizable dish built on a yeasted dough base, layered with savory tomato sauce and melted cheese. Baking it at a high temperature ensures a crisp crust and bubbly toppings, making it a perfect meal for both quick dinners and social gatherings.</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough</li>
        <li>Sauce (Tomato)</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Toppings (Your choice!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat:</strong> Set your oven to its highest temperature (usually 450°F–500°F / 230°C–260°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven now.</li>
        <li><strong>Stretch:</strong> On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll the dough into your desired circle or rectangle shape.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble:</strong> Transfer the dough to a baking sheet (or peel). Spread sauce thinly, leaving a crust border, then top with cheese and your chosen toppings.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10–15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
